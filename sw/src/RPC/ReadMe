The files that ends with *.rpc.cpp are dedicated for the RPC-based baselines. They leverage TCP-based RPC to do the remote procedure calling on the CPU, instead of STROM on the FPGA.

 The pro is that CPU cores are much closer to the memory than the FPGA, so the single reversal on the CPU can be faster than that on the FPGA. 

The con is that the TCP RTT is much longer than that of Roce.
